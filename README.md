# Things 3 MCP Server

</div>

This [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server lets you use Claude Desktop to interact with your task management data in [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things). You can ask Claude or your MCP client of choice to create tasks, analyze projects, help manage priorities, and more.

This MCP server leverages a combination of the [Things.py](https://github.com/thingsapi/things.py) library and [Things 3’s AppleScript support](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/4562654/), enabling reading and writing to Things 3.

## Why Things MCP?

This MCP server unlocks the power of AI for your task management:

- **Natural Language Task Creation**: Ask Claude to create richly-detailed tasks and descriptions in natural language
- **Smart Task Analysis**: Let Claude explore your project lists and focus areas and provide insights into your work
- **GTD & Productivity Workflows**: Let Claude help you implement productivity and prioritisation systems
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly with your existing Things 3 data

## Features

- Access to all major Things lists (Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Logbook, Someday, etc.)
- Project and Area management and assignment
- Tagging operations for tasks and projects
- Advanced search capabilities
- Recent items tracking
- Support for nested data (projects within areas, todos within projects)
- Checklist/Subtask support - Read and display existing checklist items from todos

## Installation

#### Prerequisites
* Python 3.12+
* Claude Desktop
* Things 3 for MacOS

#### Step 1: Install uv
Install uv if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
Restart your terminal afterwards.

#### Step 2: Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rossshannon/Things3-MCP
cd Things3-MCP
```

#### Step 3: Set up Python environment and dependencies
```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

### Step 4: Configure Claude Desktop
Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:
```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the Things server to the mcpServers key in the configuration file (be sure to update the path to the folder where you installed these files):
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "things": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/Things3-MCP",
                "run",
                "things_fast_server.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Restart Claude Desktop
Restart the Claude Desktop app to enable the integration.

### Sample Usage with Claude Desktop
* “What’s on my todo list today?”
* “Create a todo to pack for my beach vacation next week”
* “Evaluate my todos scheduled for today using the Eisenhower matrix.”
* “Help me conduct a GTD-style weekly review using Things.”

#### Tips
* Create a Project in Claude with custom instructions that explains how you use Things and organize areas, projects, tags, etc. Tell Claude what information you want included when it creates a new task (e.g., asking it to include relevant details in the task description, whether to use emojis, etc.).
* Try combining this with another MCP server that gives Claude access to your calendar. This will let you ask Claude to block time on your calendar for specific tasks, create tasks that relate to upcoming calendar events (e.g., prep for a meeting), etc.

## Using Tags
Things will automatically create missing tags when they are added to a task or project. Configure your LLM to do a lookup of your tags first before making changes if you want to control this.

## Development

This project uses `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies and build configuration. It's built using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), which allows Claude to securely access tools and data.

### Development Workflow

#### Setting up a development environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rossshannon/Things3-MCP
cd Things3-MCP

# Set up a virtual environment with development dependencies
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Install in development mode with extra dependencies
```

#### Testing changes during development

Run the comprehensive test suite to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
# Test the implementation
uv run pytest tests/
```

The tests clean up after themselves and don’t affect your existing data, so you can run them as often as you like.

## Troubleshooting

The server includes error handling for:
- Invalid UUIDs
- Missing required parameters
- Things database access errors
- Data formatting errors
- Authentication token issues
- AppleScript execution failures

### Common Issues

2. **Things app not running**: Make sure the Things app is running on your Mac.

### Checking Logs

All errors are logged and returned with descriptive messages. To review the MCP logs:

```bash
# Follow main logs in real-time
tail -f ~/.things-mcp/logs/things_mcp.log

# Check error logs
tail -f ~/.things-mcp/logs/things_mcp_errors.log

# View structured logs for analysis
cat ~/.things-mcp/logs/things_mcp_structured.json | jq

# Claude Desktop MCP logs
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```
